        <p>Get tough with it, get strong. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.</p>
        <p>Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree.</p>
        <p>You have to make these big decisions. <strong class="tree" style="font-family:Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-weight: bold !important">A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him.</strong> This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. </p>
